# Summary

This portfolio showcases my understanding of Cloud Security & IAM, protecting cloud environments, and managing user access effectively. Cloud Security involves implementing measures such as encryption, firewalls, and monitoring to safeguard data and resources in the cloud. Identity and Access Management (IAM) ensures that the right individuals have secure access to the appropriate resources, using tools like multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and user policies. Together, they form the foundation for secure, compliant, and efficient cloud operations.

# Cloud Security & IAM Overview

Cloud Security encompasses the strategies, policies, and technologies used to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure from cyber threats. It involves measures such as encryption, intrusion detection systems, security groups, and continuous monitoring to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud resources.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a critical component of cloud security that manages user identities and controls access to cloud resources. It involves creating and managing user accounts, setting permissions, and implementing authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized individuals can access specific data and services.

Key Components:

Encryption: Protects data at rest and in transit.
Access Controls: Define who can access what and under which conditions.
Monitoring & Auditing: Track activities for suspicious behavior and compliance.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra layer of security for user verification.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigns permissions based on user roles.
Importance:
Cloud Security & IAM are vital for safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining regulatory compliance, and ensuring operational resilience in cloud environments.:
