# Cloud Security Overview

Cloud computing has transformed the way organizations operate by providing scalable, flexible, and cost-effective infrastructure and services. However, along with these benefits come unique security challenges that require specialized strategies and controls.

This portfolio showcases my understanding of core cloud security principles across six key domains:
- Cloud Concepts, Architecture, and Design
- Cloud Data Security
- Cloud Platform and Infrastructure Security
- Cloud Application Security
- Cloud Security Operations
- Legal, Risk, and Compliance

Through practical labs, projects, and continuous learning, I aim to develop robust skills to secure cloud environments and ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and availability in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
